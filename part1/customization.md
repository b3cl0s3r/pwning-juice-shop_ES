# Customization

One of the core usage scenarios for OWASP Juice Shop is in employee
trainings in order to facilitating security awareness. With its not
entirely serious user roster and product inventory the application might
not be suited for all audiences alike.

In some particularly traditional domains or conservative enterprises it
would be beneficial to have the demo application look and behave more
like an internal application.

OWASP Juice Shop can be customized in its product inventory and look &
feel to accommodate this requirement. It also allows to add an arbitrary
number of fake users to make demonstrations - particularly those of
`UNION-SQL` injection attacks - even more impressive. Furthermore the
Challenge solved!-notifications can be turned off in order to keep the
impression of a "real" application undisturbed.

## How to customize the application

The customization is powered by a YAML configuration file placed in
`/config`. To run a customized OWASP Juice Shop you need to:

1. Place your own `.yml` configuration file into `/config`
2. Set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to the filename of your
   config without the `.yml` extension
   * On Windows: `set NODE_ENV=nameOfYourConfig`
   * On Linux: `export NODE_ENV=nameOfYourConfig`
3. Run `npm start`

You can also run a config directly in one command (on Linux) via
`NODE_ENV=nameOfYourConfig npm start`. By default the
`config/default.yml` config is used which generates the original OWASP
Juice Shop look & feel and inventory. Please note that it is not
necessary to run `npm install` after switching customization
configurations.

### Overriding `default.yml` in Docker container

In order to override the default configuration inside your Docker
container with one of the provided configs, you can pass in the
`NODE_ENV` environment variable with the `-e` parameter:

```bash
docker run -d -e "NODE_ENV=bodgeit" -p 3000:3000
```

In order to inject your own configuration, you can use `-v` to mount the
`default.yml` path inside the container to any config file on your
outside file system:

```bash
docker run -d -e "NODE_ENV=myConfig" -v /tmp/myConfig.yml:/juice-shop/config/myConfig.yml -p 3000:3000 --name juice-shop bkimminich/juice-shop
```

### Overriding default settings

When creating your own YAML configuration file, you can rely on the
existing default values and only overwrite what you want to change. The
provided `config/ctf.yml` file for capture-the-flag events for example
is as short as this:

```yaml
application:
  logo: JuiceShopCTF_Logo.png
  favicon: favicon_ctf.ico
  showChallengeHints: false
  showVersionNumber: false
  gitHubRibbon: false
ctf:
  showFlagsInNotifications: true
```

### Testing customizations

To verify if your custom configuration will not break any of the
challenges, you should run the end-to-end tests via `npm run
protractor`. If they pass, all challenges will be working fine!

## Provided customizations

The following three customizations are provided out of the box by OWASP
Juice Shop:
* [7 Minute Security](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/master/config/7ms.yml):
  Full conversion <https://7ms.us>-theme for the first podcast that
  picked up the Juice Shop way before it was famous! :sunglasses:
* [Mozilla-CTF](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/master/config/mozilla.yml):
  Another full conversion theme harvested and refined from the
  [Mozilla Austin CTF-event](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/hands-on-web-security-capture-the-flag-with-owasp-juice-shop)!
  :earth_americas:
* [The BodgeIt Store](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/master/config/bodgeit.yml):
  An homage to
  [our server-side rendered ancestor](https://github.com/psiinon/bodgeit).
  May it rest in JSPs! :skull:
* [Sick-Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/master/config/sickshop.yml):
  A store that offers a variety of illnesses and the original PoC theme
  for the customization feature. _Achoo!_ Bless you! :mask:
* [CTF-mode](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/master/config/ctf.yml):
  Keeps the Juice Shop in its default layout but disabled hints while
  enabling CTF flag codes in the _"challenge solved"_-notifications.
  Refer to [Hosting a CTF event](ctf.md) to learn more about running a
  CTF-event with OWASP Juice Shop. :triangular_flag_on_post:
* [Quiet mode](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/master/config/quiet.yml):
  Keeps the Juice Shop in its default layout but hides all _"challenge
  solved"_-notifications, GitHub ribbon and challenge hints. :mute:
* [OWASP Juice Box](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/blob/master/config/juicebox.yml):
  If you find _jo͞osbäks_ much easier to pronounce than _jo͞osSHäp_,
  this customization is for you. :us:

![Mozilla-CTF theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkimminich/pwning-juice-shop/master/part1/img/theme_mozilla.png)

![BodgeIt Store theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkimminich/pwning-juice-shop/master/part1/img/theme_bodgeit.png)

## Additional Browser tweaks

Consider you are doing a live demo with a highly customized corporate
theme. Your narrative is, that this _really_ is an upcoming eCommerce
application _of that company_. [Walking the "happy path"](happy-path.md)
might now lure you into two situations which could spoil the immersion
for the audience.

#### Coupon codes on social media

If you changed the `twitterUrl`/`facebookUrl` to the company's own
account/page, you will most likely not find any coupon codes posted
there. You will probably fail to convince the social media team to tweet
or retweet some coupon code for an application that does not even exist!

![Coupon Immersion Spoiler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkimminich/pwning-juice-shop/master/part1/img/coupon_immersion-spoiler.png)

#### OAuth Login

Another immersion spoiler occurs when demonstrating the _Log in with
Google_ functionality, which will show you the application name
registered on Google Cloud Platform: _OWASP Juice Shop_! There is no way
to convince Google to show anything else for obvious trust and integrity
reasons.

![OAuth Immersion Spoiler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkimminich/pwning-juice-shop/master/part1/img/oauth_immersion-spoiler.png)

### On-the-fly text replacement

You can solve both of the above problems _in your own Browser_ by
replacing text on the fly when the Twitter, Facebook or Google-Login
page is loaded. For Chrome
[Word Replacer II](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/word-replacer-ii/djakfbefalbkkdgnhkkdiihelkjdpbfh?hl=en)
is a plugin that does this work for you with very little setup effort.
For Firefox
[FoxReplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxreplace/)
does a similar job. After installing either plugin you have to create
two text replacements:

1. Create a replacement for `OWASP Juice Shop` (as it appears on
   Google-Login) with your own application name. Best use
   `application.name` from your configuration.
2. Create another replacement for a complete or partial Tweet or
   Facebook post with some marketing text and an actual coupon code. You
   can get valid coupon codes from the OWASP Juice Shop Twitter feed:
   <https://twitter.com/owasp_juiceshop>.

   ![Word Replacer II](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkimminich/pwning-juice-shop/master/part1/img/word_replacer_ii.png)
3. Enable the plugin and verify your replacements work:

![OAuth Immersion Replacement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkimminich/pwning-juice-shop/master/part1/img/oauth_immersion-replacement.png)
